\section{Numerical results}

In this Section, we\textquotesingle ll discuss the dynamics of the equation (\ref{eq:EquationOfMotion}), with mostly numerical results. 

The dipole\textquotesingle s dynamics was studied for small amplitude of oscillation of the magnetic field. We used two main values for the parameter $\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon = 0.05$ and $\varepsilon = 0.5$, and the following initial conditions for both cases:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        \theta (0) &= 1\\        
        \dot{\theta}(0) &= 0
    \end{cases}
\end{equation} 
In the former case, $\varepsilon = 0.05$, we verify that the dipole\textquotesingle s movement was periodic for all the values of the frequency of the magnetic field $\Omega$ in $[-3,3]$, and as expected, the dipole behaved like a simple pendulum. 

However, for the latter case, $\varepsilon = 0.5$, the dipole\textquotesingle s movement was much more complex. For some frequencies of oscillation of the external magnetic field, $\Omega$, the dynamics of magnetic dipole begin to differ from a regular pendulum, and the movement alternates between rotational and oscillatory, figure~\ref{fig:omega075}. In this case, the motion it is not periodic, and therefore the Fourier transform cannot give accurate results, resulting in regions of frequencies near zero as shown the bifurcation diagram, figure~\ref{fig:bif05}.
