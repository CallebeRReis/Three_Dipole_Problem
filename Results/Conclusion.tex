\section{Conclusion}

In this work we have investigated the dynamics of a dipole in an external oscillating magnetic field. We found that, for the most frequencies in the frequency range, $[-3,3]$, the dynamics of the dipole is very similar to a simple pendulum, figures~\ref{fig:omega05},~\ref{fig:omega20}. Nonetheless, for some specific subranges of the frequency range, a small perturbation of the external magnetic field can cause the dipole oscillate at a higher energy, figure~\ref{fig:omega075}, and in a non-periodic manner, differing from a regular pendulum. 

In order to investigate the system fully equipped with three magnets, we need to develop new methodologies, given that the movement in this case can present a dynamic even more complex than the one we studied here.
