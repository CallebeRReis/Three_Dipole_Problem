\section{Conclusion}

In this work we have investigated the dynamics of a dipole in an oscillating magnetic field, we found two main regimes, an oscillatory and a rotational one. In the oscillatory regime, the dipole behaves like a simple pendulum, where the frequency of oscillation is close related to it\textquotesingle s natural frequency. However, in the rotational regime, the dipole shown to excitable for small oscillations of the magnetic field, at specific frequencies. 

In order to investigate the system fully equipped with three magnets, we need to develop new methodologies, given that the movement in this case can present a dynamic even more complex than the one we studied here.
