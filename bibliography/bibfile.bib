   abstract = {FEL's based on the stimulated undulator radiation (ubitrons) are compared with those based on the stimulated cyclotron radiation [cyclotron autoresonance masers (CARM's)]. If the high-current accelerators are used as electron injectors, then from the viewpoint of simplicity of oscillatory electron energy pumping, criticality with respect to electron velocity dispersion, and efficiency, CARM's seem to be more effective than ubitrons at mm and sbmm waves. For such HF generators, resonators based on selective Bragg reflection of electromagnetic waves in corrugated metallic tubes are most attractive. CARM's of this type yield 6 MW at a 4 mm wavelength and 10 MW at a 2 mm wavelength in the single-mode regime. © 1983 IEEE},

   abstract = {A laser-electron-acceleration scheme based on self-sustained cyclotron resonance is discussed. Nonlinear electron dynamics in combined axisymmetric magnetic and transverse laser radiation fields is investigated. Analytic solutions are given for a circularly polarized luminous (/ck=1) radiation case, which allows time unlimited phase locking between the electrons and the accelerating electromagnetic wave. An appropriate tapering of the magnetic field in the superluminous case (/ck>1) can also lead to significant accelerations, restricted by the maximum available strength of the guide magnetic field. We discuss the entrance conditions for the accelerated beam as well as its launching into the desirable autoresonance regime through a transition region. It is shown that the radiation losses in a 1-TeV accelerator are negligible. Also, high-current-beam acceleration seems to be feasible. Nd-glass lasers with intensity of 1018 W/cm2 are capable of accelerating high-current electron beams from 0.25 to 2.5 GeV over 1 m by using a 100-kG guide magnetic field. © 1986 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Understanding the interplay of order and disorder in chaos is a central challenge in modern quantitative science. Approximate linear representations of nonlinear dynamics have long been sought, driving considerable interest in Koopman theory. We present a universal, data-driven decomposition of chaos as an intermittently forced linear system. This work combines delay embedding and Koopman theory to decompose chaotic dynamics into a linear model in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low-energy delay coordinates; this is called the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This analysis is applied to the Lorenz system and real-world examples including Earth's magnetic field reversal and measles outbreaks. In each case, forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare intermittent forcing that precedes switching and bursting phenomena. The forcing activity demarcates coherent phase space regions where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are s rongly nonlinear.},

@article{Chang1999,
   abstract = {It has been suggested that the dynamics of the Earth's magnetotail may be described by the stochastic behavior of a nonlinear dynamical system near forced and/or self-organized criticality (SOC). It has been further argued that multiscale intermittent turbulence of overlapping plasma resonances is the underlying physics that can lead to the onset and evolution of substorms. Such a description provides a convenient explanation of the localized and sporadic nature of the reconnection signatures and fractal spectra that are commonly observed in the magnetotail region. These concepts provide a new paradigm for the understanding of the ever-elusive phenomenon of magnetic substorms. In this review, we describe some of the basic physical concepts and mathematical techniques (such as the dynamic merging of coherent structures, nonclassical nonlinear instability, path integrals, the theory of the renormalization-group, low-dimensional chaos, self-similarity and scaling, fractals, coarse-grained helicity and symmetry breaking) that play a central role in the development of these new ideas. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Based on our earlier analytical results for the magnetization of magnetic fluids with respect to the magnetic field strength, we propose an expansion method within the framework of mean spherical approximation (MSA) to obtain the coefficients of different nonlinear terms. Through a Fourier expansion of the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility the harmonic coefficients corresponding to the linear and nonlinear dynamic susceptibilities are calculated from the field expansion of magnetization. The frequency dependence of the higher order susceptibilities is determined on the basis of the Debye relaxation of magnetic dipoles. Our MSA based results are in line with the corresponding limiting case of the Debye-Weiss theory. We mapped the range of applicability of the expansion method concerning the field strength and frequencies. Our results show that under weak fields a 7th order expansion is sufficient to predict the magnitudes of the susceptibility components up to the 4th harmonic relevant for magnetic fluids.}

abstract = {We study the deterministic spin dynamic of two interacting magnetic moments with anisotropy and dipolar interaction under the presence of an applied magnetic field, by using the Landau–Lifshitz equation with and without a damping term. Due to different kinds of interactions, different time scales appear: a long timescale associated with the dipolar interaction and a short timescale associated with the Zeeman interaction. We found that the total magnetization is not conserved; furthermore, for the non-dissipative case it is a fluctuating function of time, with a strong dependence on the strength of the dipolar term. In the dissipative case there is a transient time before the total magnetization reaches its constant value. We examine this critical time as a function of the distance between the magnetic moments and the phenomenological damping coefficient, and found that it strongly depends on these control parameters.}
