abstract = {Based on our earlier analytical results for the magnetization of magnetic fluids with respect to the magnetic field strength, we propose an expansion method within the framework of mean spherical approximation (MSA) to obtain the coefficients of different nonlinear terms. Through a Fourier expansion of the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility the harmonic coefficients corresponding to the linear and nonlinear dynamic susceptibilities are calculated from the field expansion of magnetization. The frequency dependence of the higher order susceptibilities is determined on the basis of the Debye relaxation of magnetic dipoles. Our MSA based results are in line with the corresponding limiting case of the Debye-Weiss theory. We mapped the range of applicability of the expansion method concerning the field strength and frequencies. Our results show that under weak fields a 7th order expansion is sufficient to predict the magnitudes of the susceptibility components up to the 4th harmonic relevant for magnetic fluids.}

abstract = {We study the deterministic spin dynamic of two interacting magnetic moments with anisotropy and dipolar interaction under the presence of an applied magnetic field, by using the Landau–Lifshitz equation with and without a damping term. Due to different kinds of interactions, different time scales appear: a long time scale associated with the dipolar interaction and a short time scale associated with the Zeeman interaction. We found that the total magnetization is not conserved; furthermore, for the non-dissipative case it is a fluctuating function of time, with a strong dependence on the strength of the dipolar term. In the dissipative case there is a transient time before the total magnetization reaches its constant value. We examine this critical time as a function of the distance between the magnetic moments and the phenomenological damping coefficient, and found that it strongly depends on these control parameters.}
