\section{Numerical Methods}

\subsection{Runge-Kutta 4th order}
In order to investigate the equation (\ref{eq:EquationOfMotion}) numerically, we used the iterative method of Runge-Kutta of fourth order (RK4), which presents a low computational cost, and fourth order accuracy, i.e, at each iteration the error is $\mathcal{O}(h^4)$, where $h$ is the integration step.

Before applying the method, we have transformed the second order differential equation of motion of dipole (\ref{eq:EquationOfMotion}), into two first order differential equation by making the transformations:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        x_1 &= \theta,\\
        x_2 &= \dot{\theta}, 
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
leading to the system of first order differential equations below:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        \dot{x_1} &= x_2,\\
        \dot{x_2} &= -\omega^2 \sin(x_1 - \varepsilon \sin(\Omega t)),
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Fourier Transform}
For the study of the frequencies present in the movement of the dipole, we first solved the differential equation numerically, 
\begin{equation}
    \int_{a}^{b}
\end{equation}
